            <p>Tooth Extraction is a dental procedure in which a damaged or problematic tooth is carefully
                removed from its socket in the jawbone. It is performed to address various dental issues,
                including severe decay, infection, or crowding, and it can help alleviate pain and prevent
                further oral health complications.
